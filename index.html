          We spend five sevenths of our lives waging in
          fluorescent cages. To live diagonal is to open your cage and walk out.

          Live Diagonal is a community whose work distills and radiates life instead of
          adding to its noise. We view technology as a means to more
          intentional living and hold communal success above all as the true
          goal of life.

          <h4>Simplicity</h4>

          <p>
            Staying alive is pretty easy. Avoid lions. Eat food. Stay warm.
            It becomes stressful as you let this list grow. Change the oil. Go
            Christmas shopping. Pay the credit cards. The <a href="reviews">Live
            Diagonal Marketplace</a> exists to help you navigate these
            difficult lifestyle decisions.

          <h4>Community</h4>

          <p>
            You can think of our community as something between a music label
            and the mob. We are a semi-decentralized network of self-motivated
            innovators working together where natural to accomplish disparate
            goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where others invest in companies, we invest in people. We are
            building a network of talented individials and we share equally in
            the value that we produce.
