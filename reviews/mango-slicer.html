				<h1>The Best Mango Slicer</h1>

				<p>
					So you wanna slice a mango, you worldly son-of-o-gun. You must be from a remote tropical nation-state where these bad boys grow faster than you could possibly
					carve em up and that effervescent aroma transports you back through time and
					space to your grandmother's summer family break-feasts and that neurostimulating
					yellow ignites primal ardour in the cockles of your ex-patriot heart and reminds
					you ceaselessly of all of the sacrifices you've had to make for this better life
					for your family and that playground and those cars. Wait you just tried your
					first mango last week? You've never cut one yourself? Oh god, you're going to
					need a tool for sure, these waters are not easy to navigate uncharted.

					<p>
						Have you ever eaten a mango with your bare hands as you gaze upon the
						distilled majesty of the universe pulsating in a Caribbean sunset? Have you ever
						licked mango juice from the sticky fingers of a lover? Probably
						not, with all the time you've been spending in the accessories section at
						Williams Sonoma.
					</p>

					<p>
						Foremost of all human pleasures is the sinful lust for fruit. It is buried in ancestral memory, just waiting for you to tap into it. How do you think Eve prepared her mango in the Garden? Do you think Satan offered her an Avoloop EZ Combination Avocado Slicer Peeler Pitter, Mango Corer, Kiwi Fruit Scoop Tool? Or do you think that she summoned her ravenous inner animal to scalp the fruit with her bare hands, feeling no shame at its revealed and supple flesh, consuming wantonly, dripping juice to olive flesh and dew-dropped earth?
					</p>

					<p>
						There is no sin in the mango itself. The sin is the arrogance of man that
						surrounds the consumption of the mango. The selfsame arrogance that analyzes the mango, overthinks its nature and seeks to control it. Grab a mango and fucking eat it some time. Get messy. Embrace life.
