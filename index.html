        <h3>Consumer Services</h3>

        <p>
          Our consumer services unit exists to promote responsible consumption. This generally means consuming as fews things as possible. If people weren't consuming an item 1,000 years ago, chances are you don't need to be consuming it right now. Wine and sex good. Avocado slicers and automated soap dispensers bad.

        <p>
          Our technology unit exists to create technology that doesn't crush the soul, and in fact, might even add something to it. We hate computers but we love this website.

        <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p>
            To bring more life into the world. More truth and freedom. More beauty and love. We deal with the subjective, objective and non-dualistic equally. We echo the fundamental truths of the universe and put into expression for the first time new ones through art, commerce, discovery and community. We are for the people, the baker and the banker, the baked and the banked.
