	<h3>Intro</h3>

	<p>
    Personally, I think that $1.75 is way too much for a dollop of
    guacamole. But not you. Like Caesar in the marketplace, you point
    your finger with ephemeral conviction at whatever your heart desires.
    And then you hand those bastards the plastic. You know the proletariat aren't
    ordering guac with level of plastered and engrained apathy and entitlement but
    until they take to the streets with pitchforks you just gonna keep doing you.
    And being a millenial, that means a lot of avocados. Time to invest in the
    infrastructure.
